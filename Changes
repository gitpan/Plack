  Incompatible Changes
        - Rename Standalone servers to HTTP::Server::PSGI
        - Rename Plack::Server adapters to Plack::Handler. These changes should be transparnt
          since we have a compatible code to work with the older names as well.
        - Dropped sendfile(2) AIO support from Standalone server
        - Plack::Request and Response are now in core, deprecating many methods.
          Read `perldoc Plack::Request` and its INCOMPATIBILITIES section

  New Features
        - New middleware: WrapCGI to convert a single CGI script into a PSGI applciation
        - Support psgix.logger and psgix.session in Plack::Request
        - New logger middleware: NullLogger, SimpleLogger, Log4perl and LogDispatch
        - Refactored Loader classes and added a new Shotgun loader (like rack's Shotgun)
        - Added -l option to plackup which specifies the Loader backend
        - New middleware: Refresh reloads modules in %INC in every N seconds
        - Wraps -e code with 'builder { }' by default. You can also use with *.psgi to add middleware
          components without editing the file!
