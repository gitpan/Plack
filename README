NAME
    Plack - PSGI reference implementation and utilities

DESCRIPTION
    Plack is a set of PSGI reference server implementations and helper
    utilities for Web application frameworks, exactly like Ruby's Rack.

    See PSGI for the PSGI specification.

MODULES AND UTILITIES
  Plack::Server
    Plack::Server is a namespace for PSGI server implementations. We have
    Standalone, CGI, FCGI, Apache, AnyEvent, Coro, Danga::Socket and many
    server environments that you can run PSGI applications on.

    See Plack::Server how to write your own server implementation.

  Plack::Loader
    Plack::Loader is a loader to load one of Plack::Server backends and run
    PSGI application code reference with it.

  Plack::Util
    Plack::Util contains a lot of utility functions for server implementors
    as well as middleware authors.

  .psgi files
    PSGI application is a code reference but it's not easy to pass code
    reference in the command line or configuration files, so Plack uses a
    convention that you need a file named "app.psgi" or alike, which would
    be loaded (via perl's core function "do") to return the PSGI application
    code reference. See eg/dot-psgi directory for the example ".psgi" files.

  plackup
    plackup is a command line launcher to run PSGI applications from command
    line using Plack::Loader to load PSGI backends. It can be used to run
    standalone servers and FastCGI daemon processes. Other server backends
    like Apache2 needs a separate configuration but ".psgi" application file
    can still be the same.

  Plack::Middleware
    PSGI middleware is a PSGI application that wraps existent PSGI
    application and plays both side of application and servers. From the
    servers the wrapped code reference still looks like and behaves exactly
    the same as PSGI applications.

    Plack::Middleware gives you an easy way to wrap PSGI applications with a
    clean API, and compatibility with Plack::Builder DSL.

  Plack::Builder
    Plack::Builder gives you a DSL that you can add "Middleware", in ".psgi"
    files to wrap existent PSGI applications.

  Plack::Request, Plack::Response
    Plack::Request gives you a nice wrapper API around PSGI $env hash to get
    headers, cookies and query parameters much like Apache::Request in
    mod_perl.

    Plack::Response does the same to construct the response array reference.

  Plack::Test
    Plack::Test is an unified interface to test your PSGI application using
    standard HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response pair with simple callbacks.

  Plack::Test::Suite
    Plack::Test::Suite is a test suite to test a new PSGI server backend.
